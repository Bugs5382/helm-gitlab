# CLAUDE.md - helm-gitlab

Working agreement for this repository. It was scaffolded from `Bugs5382/project-template`;
the governance below is shared across all repos created that way.

## Enforced by hooks (run `bash .claude/hooks/install.sh` once per clone)

- Conventional Commits on commits, issue titles, and PR titles.
- No AI tells in commits/issues/PRs/comments/source. Emoji are allowed everywhere.
- Pre-push: the ecosystem's format/lint/test gate must pass (Go: gofmt/vet/golangci-lint/test;
  npm: lint/test scripts; Python: ruff/pytest).

## Conventions

- Branching: never commit to `main`. Work on a feature/working branch; open a PR.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`type(scope): description`). The operator (@Bugs5382) is the
  author of record on every commit.
- Voice: human-authored. No attribution trailers (`Co-Authored-By`, `Generated with`), no session framing. Emoji are welcome.
- Local design notes live in a non-tracked `plan/` folder; delete a note when its work is done.

## Workflow

Issue (from a template; free-form issues are disabled) -> for sequential / multi-step work, a parent
issue with ordered **sub-issues** -> put it on the active **milestone** -> branch
`<type>/<issue#>-<slug>` -> code (comments cite the issue) -> PR with a Conventional Commit title
(the autolabeler sets the category label from the title), the template body, and a **closing
summary** before merge -> **squash** merge. The operator (@Bugs5382) is the assignee.

On merge, release-drafter drafts the next notes by label and `CHANGELOG.md` updates on `main` via the
changelog action -- **nothing tags automatically**. When the first push to main resolves the version,
rename the milestone to that version. The maintainer then **manually publishes the GitHub Release**,
which creates the tag with the finalized changelog (and triggers the publish where the repo ships a
package).

Keep public artifacts (issues, PRs, commit messages) free of references to local-only design notes.

## Releasing

On every merge to `main`, **release-drafter** drafts the next GitHub Release notes by label.
**Nothing tags or publishes automatically.** The maintainer publishes the GitHub Release by hand,
which creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag with the finalized changelog. Versioning follows SemVer.

This repo ships **source only** — no Docker image and no packaged Helm chart are published.
